              I am a graduate <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/">Electrical and computer Engineer</a>, majoring in <strong>Machine Learning and Signal Processing</strong>. I am currently working at Perception team of <a href="http://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home">Huawei Noah's Ark Research Lab</a> as an Autonomous Vehicle, Machine Learning Research Engineer, where I work on <strong>deep learning modules for self-driving vehicles</strong>.  Previously, I was a Machine Learning Research Engineer at <strong>Computer Vision/Model Compression (ANT)</strong> team of <a href="http://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home">Huawei Noah's Ark Research Lab</a>, where I worked on quantization techniques of model compression for DNN.

              I completed my Masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at McGill University. I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~bchamp/"> Professor Benoit Champagne</a> as a part of the Telecommunication and Signal Processing research team. The focus of my thesis research was on learning based single channel approach for speech enhancement. More specifically, I worked on supervised deep neural network for this problem and published a conference paper at IEEE, ISSPIT in Bilbao, Spain on December 2017. I was also an active member of <a href="http://www.sb-ieee.ece.mcgill.ca/">McGill IEEE student branch committee</a> as a Webmaster, where I designed and maintened IEEE student branch webpage.

              I have previous research experience during my final year engineering design project at Ryerson University, where I completed my B.Eng. in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering department</strong>, majoring in <strong>Multimedia and digital signal processing</strong>.
              I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/people/Fernando.html">Professor Xavier Fernando</a> on a robotic project with a team member. We built Collaborative Robots for Rescuing Underground Miners and published a paper and won the second prize of IEEE Humanitarian Initiatives Conference (HIC) at Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE) competition at Regina on May 2013.
